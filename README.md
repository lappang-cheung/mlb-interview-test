## Information
This is my simple solution for the #1 from the project questions. This application uses NextJS, Hooks and Redux in order to gather information about the
teams, roster and individual players.

## Getting Started
Need latest NodeJS and current version built on was LTS 16.

First, run the development server:
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# or
yarn install
yarn dev
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

2. Loader
